  "longDescription": "This artist is highly creative and has a vivid imagination. They thrive on delving deep into their internal world of creative invention and emerging with unique ideas. Though some may think they have their \"head in the clouds\", they know intuitively that it's not only where they're meant to be, but it's where the artistic magic is found.\n\nThe Dreamer Artist can often lose track of time while creating and find it natural and often effortless to get into a flow-state. When they can effectively capture the results of these imaginative creative sessions they will greatly increase their odds of success as an artist.\n\n## Growth Areas\n\nThough their artistic imagination is an incredible asset, The Dreamer Artist can sometimes get frustrated by the more technical aspects of their chosen medium, the limitations of equipment, or even other artists in the context of collaborations. Because of this, it can be helpful for them to collaborate with artist types who have a balancing effect on them.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nThese types include:\n\n### The Consummate Artist\nBecause they can be there to help make The Dreamer's dreams a reality, with an organized and focused technical proficiency.\n\n### The Analyzer Artist\nBecause this critically thoughtful artist type can help bring concise order and a sense of objective precision to The Dreamer's beautiful chaos whenever that is needed.\n\n### The Visionary Artist\nBecause they can help lead the way and guide a collaboration with a strong sense of direction when needed. This can have a nice balancing effect on The Dreamer's creative process.\n\n### The Maverick Artist\nBecause they are not only predisposed to understanding The Dreamer Artist's imaginative ways, but are also quite capable of supporting their ideas with rock solid practical processes and confidence in their execution. This can be an incredibly beneficial collaborative matchup.",
