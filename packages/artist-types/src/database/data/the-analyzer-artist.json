  "longDescription": "This artist has a sharp, analytical creative mind and a keen sense of artistic taste. They know what they like and what they don't like and they hold themselves to very high standards. This discerning, critical intellect drives them forward and helps them push themselves (and often others) toward excellence.\n\nMore so than many other artist types they're willing to be hard on themselves and are always seeking to be better. This can lead to great rewards, but can also sometimes lead to frustration, self-doubt or even burnout.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nFor this reason it can be incredibly helpful for The Analyzer Artist to seek collaborators who can provide some natural balance to their often intense approach. These types include:\n\n### The Consummate Artist\nBecause their highly technical and professional approach can help give The Analyzer Artist a balanced, objective perspective at times when they might be too hard on themselves. They can do this while still being a reliable sounding board, provided their personalities and tastes interact well.\n\n### The Tech Artist\nBecause they share an analytical perspective while also having a focused skillset that makes them adept at getting high quality results through using their technical prowess.\n\n### The Visionary Artist\nBecause this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments The Analyzer Artist's particularly detail-oriented and focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing.\n\n## Collaborating with Similar Temperaments\n\nWhen collaborating with The Feeler Artist, The Solo Artist, or The Tortured Artist, it's helpful for The Analyzer Artist to consider that they have similar temperaments, so it can be helpful to know there may be a lot of emotional energy present. With a foundation of mutual respect, they're likely to feed off of each other's intensity and find they have a unique kinship and they are similar types. They both care deeply about your work and this can make for an incredibly fruitful collaboration.",
