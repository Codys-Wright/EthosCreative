  "shortDescription": "Though it may seem like a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits this type well; they often genuinely suffer for their artistry. The Tortured Artist uses their creativity as a means of seeking catharsis; to purge or better understand their internal struggles by expressing them artistically. Their work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.",
  "longDescription": "Though it may seem like a bit of a cliché, the archetype of the tortured artist actually fits this type well; they really do tend to suffer for their artistry. Their work is often deeply powerful, meaningful, and unique; the result of deep consideration and personal expression.\n\nThey often deal with significant internal tension during their creative process and struggle with feeling pleased with the final result. Still, they're deeply driven to express, create, and improve. Though they may have a melancholic disposition, they often find solace and comfort in it.\n\n## Career Considerations\n\nWhen it comes to career considerations, it's not uncommon for them to be at odds with all that is involved in the process of monetizing their work. Though they feel the tension between art and commerce in very personal ways, it's their sensitivity that makes their work both meaningful and potentially highly valuable to audiences and in the context of business.\n\nIn many ways the difficulties they deal with during their creative process are just extensions of their ability to tune in with the harsh realities of life that others may shy away from. Instead they naturally dive in and embrace this side of life and emerge with powerfully beautiful art. It's artists like them who tend to make the kind of work that can be deeply meaningful and even therapeutic to both themselves and their audiences.\n\n## Self-Care\n\nDue to The Tortured Artist's sensitive nature, it's particularly important for them to focus on self-care and a healthy lifestyle to help balance out the passionate intensity they bring to their work. They'll greatly benefit from making it a priority to actively seek this kind of balance as it will enhance their quality of life, so they can be fully themselves and yet still experience fulfillment and enjoyment through their artistry.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nDue to the fact that The Tortured Artist takes their work very seriously and tends toward melancholy, they can benefit from collaborating with other artist types who can uplift and propel them forward in a way that is balancing. These include:\n\n### The Feeler Artist\nBecause they bring an extroverted, \"in the moment\", often positive emotional energy to their work. This can propel and uplift The Tortured Artist when that kind of energy is helpful.\n\n### The Analyzer Artist\nBecause this type is focused not just on the art itself but equally on organizing the process and on the business side of things. This can free The Tortured Artist up to stay more focused on the art, while The Analyzer Artist can consider ways to guide the process with a \"bird's eye view\" and offer up a helpful and balanced perspective.\n\n### The Visionary Artist\nBecause they will help keep a consistent forward momentum all the way to the end, regardless of the emotional ups and downs that may be encountered throughout the process. They tend to see the full picture of a project (in their mind's eye) and can help guide The Tortured Artist there.",
