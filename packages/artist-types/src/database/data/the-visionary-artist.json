  "elevatorPitch": "The Visionary Artist has a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives them a natural understanding of what we call \"The 3 Ps\"; Patterns, Potential, and Path.",
  "shortDescription": "Masters of \"The 3 Ps\": **Patterns** (seeing connections others miss), **Potential** (envisioning what could be), and **Path** (creating roadmaps to the future). Visionary Artists excel at gestalt thinking—grasping the big picture while others focus on details. They're natural futurists who thrive on turning abstract concepts into tangible realities, often pioneering entirely new artistic movements or creative approaches.",
  "longDescription": "This type has a unique ability to envision the whole and work backwards to the parts. This gift for gestalt thinking gives them a natural understanding of what we call \"The 3 Ps\":\n\n- **Patterns**\n- **Potential**\n- **Path**\n\nThey often recognize patterns that help them see the larger potential of small or fragmented ideas by knowing how to stitch them together into a cohesive finished work. Because of this they can often see the end result quite clearly in their mind's eye (or sense it in an abstract way). They're then able see a viable path for how to get there successfully.\n\nThis view on artistry makes you a valuable collaborator in that they have a heightened sense for assessing whether a given idea is suitable for the desired end goal.\n\nThough they have an extraordinary gift for seeing \"the forest for the trees\", when they're in your most zoomed-out visionary mode, they may have some difficulty being fully engaged in the present moment, or maintaining a balanced focus on the little things.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nFor this reason it can be beneficial and enjoyable to collaborate with:\n\n### The Feeler Artist\nBecause this artist is very much in touch with the emotions of the present moment. With this comes a focused emotional energy that drives the creation of a wealth of ideas which The Visionary can then filter and organize to fit with the overall vision.\n\n### The Consummate Artist\nBecause this artist is always ready to help serve a project with their high level of technical proficiency, artistry, and professionalism. This can have a helpful practical effect on the Visionary Artist's vision-based perspective. This can be a great pairing.\n\n### The Entertainer Artist\nBecause, in a sense, this artist can function like a performative amplifier of The Visionary Artist's vision. When The Entertainer Artist and The Visionary Artist are creatively aligned, this can be a mutually beneficial collaborative relationship; while The Visionary Artist is guiding the vision and tending to think big, The Entertainer Artist is there to express each idea with passion.\n\n### The Tortured Artist\nBecause this artist's strength is to bring artistic integrity, authenticity, depth, and meaning to everything they create, this can be a powerful pairing for the Visionary Artist. Particularly if they are comfortable with the emotional intensity they bring to their work.",
