  "longDescription": "This artist is emotionally present and highly expressive. They have a rich inner world of thoughts and emotion that are constantly ebbing and flowing. They're sensitive and empathetic nature is what guides and defines them creatively. They have a gift for bringing emotional depth to their work, particularly when they feel comfortable and free.\n\nThey bring a vibrant energy to creative situations and are often a wellspring of fresh and emotive ideas. In collaborations they're likely to feel most at home when their collaborators respect their process and welcome the ideas as they flow.\n\nWhen The Feeler Artist is on, they're a \"lightning in a bottle\" factory. For this reason, they'll work best with those who are adept at harnessing that lightning in a nonjudgemental and encouraging way. A potential downside is that this artist type can shut down creatively if they don't feel supported, or when their work is criticized in a blunt, haphazard, or insensitive way.\n\n## Growth Areas\n\nThe Feeler Artist's strength is in this sensitive, emotionally present nature, but sometimes they may find it difficult to see beyond what they're feeling. This can lead to overwhelm or a sense of being stuck. In this way, their ability to be present and emotionally connected is both a strength and a potential liability in some situations. To stay in their sweet spot, it's important to choose collaborators who are empathetic and caring. It's also important for them to listen to their internal stress signals so they'll know when they may need a break to recenter, so they can get back to where they need to be emotionally to create at their best. When they take responsibility for their emotions while also nurturing and aiming them in productive ways, their sensitivity is their artistic and relational superpower. The best art expresses the depth of human experience and emotion, and this is The Feeler Artist's specialty.\n\n## The 3 F's\n\nThe Feeler Artist is most succinctly defined by what we call \"The 3 F's\":\n\n- **Focus** - They're able to Focus on the here and now\n- **Feel** - As they Feel in touch with their current emotions\n- **Follow** - While knowing how to Follow their instincts while creating\n\nThey're an asset to most any creative situation.\n\n## Collaborating with Other Feelers\n\nIn collaborations with another Feeler Artist, they'll both benefit from remembering to leave space for each other's ideas to be given proper consideration. It's a room with two big sensitive hearts, so they should proceed with care! If they do, they can amplify each other's artistry and create incredibly emotive work.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nTo help balance their sensitive creative nature, they'll often be most productive and do their best work when collaborating with Artist Types that are adept at organizing ideas and guiding the process from a perspective that tends to be more objective and even keel. These artist types include:\n\n### The Tech Artist\nBecause they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture The Feeler Artist's expressive ideas well, so they can stay in the zone.\n\n### The Visionary Artist\nBecause this type is always thinking about the big picture and broad strokes, which compliments The Feeler Artist's hyper-focused creativity. This can be a very mutually beneficial pairing.\n\n### The Consummate Artist\nBecause they tend to keep a consistent energy that has a nice balancing effect on The Feeler Artist. They are focused on helping others with their ideas while bringing a high level of technical proficiency and project organization.",
