  "shortDescription": "Possesses an instinctual understanding of technology that goes beyond mere technical skill—they intuitively grasp how digital tools can amplify creative expression. Tech Artists are naturally inventive and unusually productive, often creating their own workflows, tools, and systems. They see technology not as a constraint but as an infinite canvas for creative exploration.",
  "longDescription": "Not only is The Tech Artist a deeply creative and expressive artist, but more so than most, they also have an instinctual understanding of how to effectively use the equipment and technology involved in making their creative ideas a reality in their chosen medium. They have a natural affinity for the tools of their trade and great instincts for knowing how to navigate, harness, and leverage them to express a creative idea or vision.\n\nThey are highly industrious and naturally driven to find both unique creative processes and get great artistic results using these modern tools. They thrive when they can completely immerse themselves in their work and emerge with the magic elements that bring an idea to life in compelling and inventive ways.\n\nThey also understand the importance of staying in touch with the rapidly changing landscape of the tech world and seek to integrate those innovations into their creative work flow, if it enhances the results. This makes The Tech Artist a huge asset to almost any creative situations in their chosen field. They thrive in settings where they can apply this tech-savvy skillset to a creative situation where it's needed and appreciated.\n\n## Growth Areas\n\nThough it's most often a positive thing, their tech-focused nature can pull their focus away from that which is outside that tech realm. Because they have a mind that's swimming with ideas (and they're often actively engaged in bringing them to life with their favorite software), it can sometimes be easy to forget to interact meaningfully on a human level with their collaborators and fully consider their ideas and feelings. It's also easy to forget that their client or collaborator(s) may not yet understand how and what they're cooking up! Keeping this in mind, and focusing on being communicative about what they're up to can be helpful in collaborations. Equally important can be to choose partners and/or collaborators who balance them well.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nHere are a list of some of the Artist Types that The Tech Artist may work well with and some of the reasons why:\n\n### The Feeler Artist\nBecause they can be good at generating lots of powerfully emotive ideas that can feed The Tech Artist's fire and bring that extra flair of magic and humanity to the digital domain.\n\n### The Visionary Artist\nBecause they can help The Tech Artist zoom out when they're in a hyper-focused state of mind.\n\n### The Entertainer Artist\nBecause they can bring an extroverted, fun energy to a session and they're often ready to contribute in exciting ways at any given moment.\n\n### The Consummate Artist\nBecause they're focused on finding the best context for their abilities and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals. These two artists are very much cut from the same cloth.\n\n### The Dreamer Artist\nBecause they can often bring an added sense of wonder and imagination to the creative process. When things start to feel a bit too grounded in the \"ones and zeroes\", The Dreamer Artist is often soaring through the clouds creating some ethereal magic that you can then harness and organize.",
