  "elevatorPitch": "The Solo Artist is the epitome of the serious, introspective and thoughtful artist. Their work is highly personal and they likely consider it to be a direct extension of who they are inside. They're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Their core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of their own tastes and perspectives.",

  "longDescription": "This artist type is the epitome of the serious, introspective and thoughtful artist. Their work is highly personal and they likely consider it to be a direct extension of who they are inside. They're not only comfortable working alone, but tend to prefer it over collaborations. Their core goal is to create work that is a direct reflection of their own tastes and perspectives.\n\nThis artist tends to be self-contained in most ways and enjoy controlling most or all elements of their creative process because it makes it more personal and unique. As a Solo Artist they're likely known for the authenticity and uniqueness of their work, which is one of their most valuable artistic qualities.\n\nThough they may be more reclusive and introverted than other artists, The Solo Artist is not necessarily always anti-social. They're inventive and often highly industrious and enjoy venturing into the artistic unknown to discover where it will lead. They're as interested in the process as the result.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nThough The Solo Artist is most comfortable working alone, it can be beneficial for them to explore collaborations (or get constructive feedback) from other artist types including:\n\n### The Analyzer Artist\nBecause they're adept at giving constructive feedback from a perspective that isn't as closely tied to the intimate details. This can be helpful for The Solo Artist in cases when they're perhaps too close to a project to have a balanced view on the overall picture.\n\n### The Entertainer Artist\nBecause they may be able to provide The Solo Artist with a potentially valuable outside (audience-focused) perspective on their work. Also, if and when it's a good fit, The Entertainer Artist is often at the ready to perform their collaborative work (if indeed The Solo Artist is seeking that kind of situation).\n\n### The Maverick Artist\nBecause they're not only technically proficient and artistic, but also predisposed to generating lots of unique ideas from varied angles with a high degree of infectious self-confident energy. So they are likely to both understand The Solo Artist and offer a helpful perspective.",
