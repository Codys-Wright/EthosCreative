  "longDescription": "This artist lives to perform. Whether for a huge audience or just one other person, they thrive on sharing their talents with people and feel right at home being the center of attention. They have a natural charisma and have a gift for bringing people together. They have the ability to light up a room with a unique and obvious energy that defies explanation.\n\nThey put the \"show\" in show business and have a natural ability to remember that sometimes it's all about giving their audience what they want. This is a highly valuable trait and something that other more introverted artist types can forget, or neglect.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nThough they're often the star of the show (and rightly so), it can be helpful in creative situations to collaborate with those who have a more thoroughly introspective and measured artistic temperament. These types include:\n\n### The Consummate Artist\nBecause their highly technical and professional approach can help free up The Entertainer Artist to entertain, knowing that everything is taken care of with the utmost care. This is usually a very mutually beneficial match.\n\n### The Maverick Artist\nBecause though they intuitively understand the importance of performance, they thrive when they can be both creative and handle technical elements. They're a kindred spirit who can bring some good creative direction to collaborations with The Entertainer Artist, while retaining a fun unpredictability that remains productive.\n\n### The Tortured Artist\nBecause if there's ever a need for added emotional depth and a thorough commitment to authenticity, this artist is always tuned in to those elements. If they get along personally, and navigate any disagreements well, this pair can form a tight bond that can bring exciting results.\n\n### The Visionary Artist\nBecause they can help to give The Entertainer Artist a perspective that can sometimes be missed in the heat of the moment. Their \"zoomed out\" perspective can be highly valuable to The Entertainer Artist just as their ability to be \"zoomed in\" can help them understand how important it is to be engaged and present.\n\n## Collaborating with Similar Temperaments\n\n**NOTE:** When collaborating with The Maverick Artist, The Solo Artist, or The Dreamer Artist, it's helpful to consider that often some Entertainer Artists have fairly similar temperaments, so it can be helpful to put some effort into \"sharing the stage\", so to speak. With an open mind, they're likely to feed off of each other's energies and find they have a unique kinship.",
