  "longDescription": "The Maverick is a highly inventive and unique artist with a gift for being unpredictable in creatively beneficial ways. A rebel with a cause, The Maverick Artist is a creative force of nature that balances artistry and productivity.\n\nEven in collaborations they tend to be the artistic lone wolf, focused on paving their own way. That said, they're often happy to bring their collaborators along for the ride, if they're willing to follow The Maverick Artist's lead and add fuel to their fire.\n\nThey have the unique ability to generate a whirlwind of creative energy that inspires others and leads to work that can be unconventional or surprising.\n\n## Growth Areas\n\nGiven a pronounced focus on being unique, at times it can be difficult for The Maverick Artist to work in conventional ways or deliver consistent results within more restrictive guidelines or tightly defined genres. For this reason it can be helpful for them to collaborate with artist types that balance them out.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nThese include:\n\n### The Consummate Artist\nBecause they're focused on using proven approaches and on helping others realize their creative vision and reach their goals in a streamlined and focused way.\n\n### The Entertainer Artist\nBecause in some ways they're cut from the same cloth, yet they have different goals. They'll both enjoy bringing ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, whereas one is born to entertain, The Maverick's focus can be on creating what they'll want to perform. If their tastes align and their personalities gel, this can be an exhilarating collaborative pairing.\n\n### The Tech Artist\nBecause they're happy to handle the technical details in a way that helps capture The Maverick Artist's unique ideas well, and facilitate whatever they throw at them. This can be a mutually beneficial pairing.",
