  "longDescription": "This artist is as creative as they are technically proficient. They have good aesthetic taste and a meticulous approach to their craft. This makes them the quintessential professional artist.\n\nTheir collaborators and associates are likely to consider them to be an asset to any project they're involved in. They have a gift for solving creative problems and providing the right idea at the right time while also choosing the right tool for the job from a technical or equipment perspective.\n\nThey're artistically expressive and value raw authenticity, but never without concern for the overall objective quality of their work. They're highly analytical and at times they may find themselves more focused on finding and fixing flaws than on enjoying what is naturally working. This can be a blessing and a curse, but it drives them forward toward excellence.\n\nThe Consummate Artist often has a firm grasp of the relevant history of their chosen medium while also being focused on learning new things. They have a natural desire to keep their finger on the pulse of the latest trends and are likely keep up with useful technological advancements.\n\n## Ideal Collaborators\n\nThough they're often highly creative, knowledgeable, and work well with most people, they can benefit greatly from seeking collaborations with those who tend to have a more free-spirited, self-taught, or abstract approach to creativity. These types include:\n\n### The Visionary Artist\nBecause this type is thinking big, they can provide a grand vision which The Consummate Artist can help bring to life in practical ways. A very synergistic match.\n\n### The Feeler Artist\nBecause they are a wellspring of ideas that are emotionally rich yet often can come in random or disorganized ways that The Consummate Artist can help order and aim effectively.\n\n### The Entertainer Artist\nBecause this type is always ready to bring ideas to life in vivid and uninhibited ways, The Consummate Artist can help make sure that the presentation is professional and that all the important details are covered; every \"i\" is dotted and every \"t\" crossed. Virtually every Entertainer would benefit from collaborating with The Consummate Artist, and vice versa.\n\n### The Tortured Artist\nBecause their work is emotionally intense and tends to be less overtly and objectively intellectualized, these two can often act as yin and yang. This can be a best of both worlds combination if they get along personality wise.\n\n### The Dreamer Artist\nBecause the dreamer brings a highly imaginative \"head in the clouds\" energy to all they're involved in, they benefit from an organizational and guiding presence The Consummate Artist provides. Conversely, The Consummate Artist benefits from working with the ideas of someone who is tuned in with the intangible in ways that can make for highly effective collaborations.\n\n## The Creative Business Asset\n\nOf all the artist types The Consummate Artist is one of the most adaptive and naturally built for creative business settings. In a world where many artists can tend to be a bit scattered or even disorganized and unreliable (relatively speaking), The Consummate Artist is the notable exception and that is often greatly appreciated by those they work with.",
