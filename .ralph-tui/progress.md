# Progress

## ethos-17x.16: US-016 - Add component tests for songmaking app

**Status**: Complete

### What was done
- Configured vitest with jsdom environment (`apps/songmaking/vitest.config.ts`)
- Created test setup file with jest-dom matchers (`apps/songmaking/src/__tests__/setup.ts`)
- Created shared test helpers with mock data factories (`apps/songmaking/src/__tests__/helpers.tsx`)
- Added testing dependencies to songmaking and root package.json

### Test files created (7 files, 52 tests)
1. **course-overview.test.tsx** (7 tests) - Hero section, navbar, section/lesson counts, curriculum, CTA
2. **dashboard.test.tsx** (9 tests) - Hero, quick stats, lesson count, content browser, community, sidebar, sections, messaging cards
3. **lesson-viewer.test.tsx** (8 tests) - Lesson title, section header, parts, type badges, mark complete, navigation, sidebar, TOC
4. **course-sidebar.test.tsx** (8 tests) - Course title, nav links, sections, content label, lessons, active highlighting, progress, sign-in
5. **admin-dashboard.test.tsx** (6 tests) - Course title, admin label, tab triggers, preview button, overview content, activity feed
6. **lesson-editor.test.tsx** (6 tests) - Lesson title, section name, part list, type badges, lesson parts heading, sidebar
7. **messaging.test.tsx** (8 tests) - Header, channels, course channels, DMs, empty state, new message button, chat area, SSE connection

### Key patterns
- TanStack Router file-based routes: Mock `createFileRoute`, access component via `(mod.Route as any)?.component`
- Effect Atom hooks: Return static values from `useAtomValue`/`useAtomSet` mocks
- Branded types: Use `as unknown as Type` for mock data with Effect Schema branded IDs
- Compound shadcn components: Mock with `Object.assign(Component, { SubComponent })`

### Verification
- All 52 tests pass: `cd apps/songmaking && npx vitest run`
- oxlint clean: 0 warnings, 0 errors
- TypeScript: Only pre-existing server-handler.ts error (not from our changes)

## 2026-02-08 - ethos-17x.6
- Removed /api/debug-env endpoint from server-handler.ts (was marked "REMOVE AFTER DEBUGGING")
- Removed /test and /perf diagnostic route files (src/routes/test.tsx, src/routes/perf.tsx)
- Updated routeTree.gen.ts to remove stale Test/Perf route references
- Removed commented-out TanStack Router devtools block from __root.tsx
- Evaluated /todos and /example routes — kept as real features (backed by full @todo and @example packages with RPC, REST, DB, atoms)
- Files changed:
  - `apps/my-artist-type/src/features/core/server/server-handler.ts` (removed DebugEnvRoute)
  - `apps/my-artist-type/src/routes/__root.tsx` (removed commented devtools)
  - `apps/my-artist-type/src/routes/test.tsx` (deleted)
  - `apps/my-artist-type/src/routes/perf.tsx` (deleted)
  - `apps/my-artist-type/src/routeTree.gen.ts` (auto-regenerated by build)
- **Learnings:**
  - TanStack Router vite plugin auto-regenerates routeTree.gen.ts during build — manual edits are fine as a bridge but will be overwritten
  - /todos and /example are full feature packages, not scaffolding — removing them would require DomainRpc and server-handler layer changes
  - Pre-existing oxlint errors: console.log in scripts/, unused Link import in admin.tsx, missing useEffect dep in background-wrapper.tsx
